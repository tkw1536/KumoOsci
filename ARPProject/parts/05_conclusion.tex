\label{sec:conclusion}

In the course of this project we have experimentally investigated Kuramoto oscilators with negative coefficients and developed a method to construct graph topologies that generate desired synchronisation behaviour. 

Research in this topic is however far from complete. So far we have only generated experimental evidence and did not perform an analytical analysis of our approach. Furthermore our approach has some caveats, such as needing more oscilators in the generated topology than those that are involved in the pattern directly. Future work could try to optimise these solutions by using weights that are different from -1 and 0, or by using different topologies.

\ednote{Alee: Write about the system: Describe the equation in general and what each constant means. No graphs here yet, just the basic explanation. }
\ednote{Alee: Write about the simulation we have written, i.e. we used Numpy, we have a script that can handle arbritrary parameters and make a simple **positive coefficient** system where you can explain the connection. }
\ednote{Alee[potentially saturday]: Write about system stability (i. e. switch to a constant frame of reference, find fix points and take the Jacobian)}

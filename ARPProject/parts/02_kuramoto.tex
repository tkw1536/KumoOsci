\ednote{Alee: Write about the system (i. e. Equation and what is each constant)}
\ednote{Alee: Write about the simulation we have written, i.e. we used Numpy, we have a script that can handle arbritrary parameters, its plots these kinds of graphs}
\ednote{Alee[potentially saturday]: Write about system stability (i. e. switch to a constant frame of reference, find fix points and take the Jacobian)}
